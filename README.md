This project make use of ReactJS for creating components of the different pages, and here we have components like Navbar, Hero, Cards, etc. By using these components create pages of website like Homepage, Jobspage, AddJobpage, etc.
Styling this site by using TailWindCSS, for routing here make use of react-router-dom and the icons from react-icons.
Data that used here is from json-server a simple server that can be used to store json form of data and by using property like asynchronous JS fetch data from json-server and make use of it.
To improve this project we can do some authentication, and use database and backend server to impove its funcionality.
